## Scanning

### Functionality

#### Scan Types
There are 4 types of scan:

• _Single Show_ – A single show can be scanned manually.

• _Quick Scan_ - A ‘clever’ scan that looks in the download directory for shows to scan. It also scans missing episodes from the recent list. <Recommended>

• _Recent Scan_ – A scan that looks at all shows that have had an episode aired in the last few days. The number of days can be specified in the preferences.

• _Full Scan_ – Scans all shows that are set to be scanned.

#### Triggering Scans

These can be triggered in several ways:

• On Startup

• Via Command Line

• Periodic (Automated)

• When download/search folder/file changes

• Manually Further Information

• Configuration options are detailed in [**Options>Preferences>Scan Options**](/manual/options/#the-scan-options-tab "Read about Scan Options")

• Further explanation can be found [**here**](/manual/user/#scan "Read about Scanning").

### Future Ideas
• To incorporate a ‘Bulk add’ as part of the scan and use the new ‘Quick Add’ Dialog to quickly add missing shows.
