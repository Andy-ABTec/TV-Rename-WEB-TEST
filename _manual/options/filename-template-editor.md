## Filename Template Editor

![The Filename Template Editor tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/filename-template-editor-01.png){:.pic-l}
This is where the format of the filenames that TV&nbsp;Rename will rename to are defined.

To help illustrate the results the "Sample and Test:" panel contains the processed entries from the show and season selected in the _**My Shows**_ tab.

The "Naming template:" text box displays a tokenised version of the filename which can be edited directly or populated using the "Tags:" drop-down, or overwritten with a record selected from the "Presets:" drop-down. Any changes in the "Naming Template:" are automatically reflected in the "Sample and Test:" panel.

The available tags with their definitions are listed below: -

|{ShowName} |Name of the Show |
|{Season} |Number of the season |
|{Season:2} |Number of the season forced to 2 characters with a leading zero |
|{Episode} |Number of the episode (within a season), eg S01E03 |
|{Episode2} |Number of the second episode of a pair (within a season), eg S01E04-E05 |
| | created by the default S{Season:2}E{Episode}[-E{Episode2}]) |
|{EpisodeName}|Name of the Episode |
|{Number} |Overall number of the episode |
|{Number:2} |Overall number of the episode forced to 2 characters with a leading zero |
|{Number:3} |Overall number of the episode forced to 3 characters with leading zero(s)|
|{SeasonNumber} |Some season numbers do not start at 1, eg they may go 2012,2013,2014. {SeasonNumber} is the nth season, so would be 1,2,3 in this example |
|{SeasonNumber:2} |As above, but forced to 2 characters with a leading zero |
|{ShortDate} |Air date in short format, eg 25/12/2017 |
|{LongDate} |Air date in lomg format, eg 25 December 2017 |
|{YMDDate} |Air date in YMD format, eg 2017/12/25 |
|{AllEpisodes}|All episodes - E01E02 etc |

| _Default:_ | _**{ShowName} - S{Season:2}E{Episode}[-E{Episode2}] - {EpisodeName}**_ |
| | (the second preset). |
