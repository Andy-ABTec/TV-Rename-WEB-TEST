## Offline Operation

If **Offline Operation** is enabled TV&nbsp;Rename will firstly prompt you to make sure you wish to go offline, and if you click `Yes` it will run on locally cached data from [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit thetvdb.com"). This will stop TV&nbsp;Rename attempting to update.
