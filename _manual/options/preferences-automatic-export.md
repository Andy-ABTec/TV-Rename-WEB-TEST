Ticking the "RSS" box in the "When to watch" section of the panel will save a RSS-reader compatible XML file to the location you specify (by typing or browsing). This file can then be read by something like XBOX Media Center, or a Windows RSS App.

Ticking the "XML" box in the "When to watch" section of the panel will save a standard XML file to the location you specify (by typing or browsing).

In either case you can limit how many days or shows are written to the file. The files are updated whenever the "When to watch" tab is manually or automatically refreshed.

Ticking the "XML" box in the "Missing" section of the panel will save a standard XML file containing the missing episodes detected during a scan to the location you specify (by typing or browsing)

Ticking the "TXT" box in the "All Shows" section of the panel will save a TXT file whenever a show is added, edited or deleted from TV Rename. It also gets updated when `Auto ID All` in the *Scan Results* tab of **Tools>Folder Monitor** is clicked.
