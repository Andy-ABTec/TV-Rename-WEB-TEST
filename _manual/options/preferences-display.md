### The Display Tab

![Preferences - The Display tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-display-01.png){:.pic-l}

*Double-click in When to Watch does:*
Controls the double-click action in the _**[When to watch]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/user#when-to-watch "Read about When to watch")**_ tab. Options are Search and Scan.

_Default:_ _**Search**_

The *Startup Tab:* selects which tab you wish open when TV&nbsp;Rename loads. _**My&nbsp;Shows**_, _**Search**_ or _**When to Watch**_.

_Default:_ _**My Shows**_

The *Show Notification Area* and *Show in Taskbar* interact, one of them **must** be ticked. If you try to un-tick both the option you are changing clears, but the other one automatically sets.

If *Show in Taskbar* is selected TV&nbsp;Rename's icon appears in the Windows taskbar.<br />
If *Show Notification Area* is selected TV&nbsp;Rename's icon appears in the System Tray. Right-clicking it will show an "Upcoming Shows" list, and double clicking restores the main window.<br />
Both boxes can be ticked, in which case you get both functionalities.

| *Defaults:* | "Show Notification Area" | _**Un-ticked**_ |
| | "Show in Taskbar" | _**Ticked**_ |

*Show episode pictures in episode guides* Does what-it-says-on-the-tin, if ticked screen grabs from show episodes are displayed with the episode description in the _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ tab. If un-ticked only the episode description is displayed.

_Default:_ _**Ticked**_

*Hide Spoilers in My Shows* hides the display of summaries of yet to be broadcast episodes (with a suitable message) in the _**My Shows**_  tab

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_

*Hide Spoilers in When To Watch* hides the display of summaries of yet to be broadcast episodes (with a suitable message) in the _**When to watch**_ tab

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_

*Automatically select show and season in My&nbsp;Shows*
If ticked this works for both the _**When to watch**_ and _**Scan**_ tabs. If an item is selected in either of these tabs the _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ tab is automatically updated to highlight the indicated show and season.

_Default:_ _**Ticked**_

The next two options are self explanatory, however please note that they only affect the "season" display in the _**My Shows**_ tab.

![Preferences - the Tree Coloring tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-tree-coloring-01.png){:.pic-l}
If you have a large catalogue of old TV Shows that you want to keep on the system, the _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ tab can be somewhat cluttered, but you don't want to remove anything from TV Rename. _**Tree Coloring**_ to the rescue...

Tree coloring allows you to change the color of the text on the left hand pane of the _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ tab depending on the status of the show or the show season.

To create a record:-
* Expand the _"Status:"_ drop-down and select the status you wish to match from the list.
* Select a color to associate with the status by either entering a web-safe color name or code in the _"Text Color:"_ box or clicking `Select Colour` and choosing from the pallet.
* Click the `Add` button and your new entry will appear the box above.

For example: to make finished shows less obtrusive in _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ expand the _"Status:"_ drop-down and select _"Show Status: Ended"_, in the _"Text Color:"_ box type _"#808080"_ and click `Add`. Back in the _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ tab; text for shows that have finished will be light grey and less obtrusive.

If you wish to remove a rule from the list just select it and click `Remove`.
