### The Library Folders Tab

![Preferences - the Library Folders tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-library-folders-01.png){:.pic-l}
The Library Folders tab is used to tell TV&nbsp;Rename about the location(s) of your Media Library - viz where to look for TV Show episode files **AFTER** they have been processed.

Use the `Add` button to browse to the folder that is the "Base" folder of your Media Library. and click `OK`.

You can also highlight a path in the list and use the `Remove` button to remove it, and highlight a path in the list and use `Open` to check its contents in a File Explorer window.

"Base" folder refers to a path on your system that corresponds to the location of your media files.
```

For the folder structure illustrated (above left) the base folder would be "D:\media\Video\TV&nbsp;Shows".

This could also be a UNC path (above right) for example: "\\\nas-1\media\Video\TV Shows".

_Additional Scan Options_ allow manipulation of the Medial Library contents. 

_Update files and folders with air date_, if ticked, will modify the time stamp of files and folders in the Media Library to match the original air date of the episode being copied or moved.

_Default: **Un-ticked**_

**NOTE:**{:style="color:red;"} If you use a NAS device as your media library and it is Linux based it has an epoch date of 01/01/1970&nbsp;00:00. Files cannot have a date/time-stamp earlier than this. If you have any TV Show episodes whose original release date was earlier and you have the _Update files and folders with air date_ box ticked they will be set to 01/01/1970&nbsp;00:00.

| Automatically create merge rules for merged library episodes | _**Un-ticked**_ |
| Automatically create missing folders | _**Un-ticked**_ |

_Bulk Add_ can be run from the menu of the application or configured to be run as part of each scan.

_Default: * | | |
| | Do Bulk Add as part of scan | _**Un-ticked**_ |

Looking at the *Bulk Add:* section, two options are available and they both work as "junk filters".

Firstly, *Only Include Folders containing Video Files* if ticked restricts the "Bulk Add" scan to only include folders with video files.

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_

And Secondly, *Ignore Recycle Bin* tells the "Bulk Add" scan to exclude the (Windows) Recycle Bin even if it contains video files.

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_

And Finally, *Force to Use Season Words from Settings only* tells the "Bulk Add" scan to just use the words entered in the preferences when it is scanning to decide whether the series has a flat structure or a 'folder by season' structure.

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_


The next two preferences allow you to set the text for the Specials and Season folders - useful if you speak "English as a second language".

The "Specials folder name:" text box allows you to modify the name used when creating a "Specials" folder for a show.

It is common practice for specials to be labeled as part of "Season 0" so for example: special 3 of "Battlestar Galactica" would be labeled "Battlestar Galactica - S00E03 - The Story So Far"  and stored (by default) in the "Specials" folder.

_Default:_ _**Specials**_

Similarly, the "Season folder format:" text box allows you to customise the name used when creating a "Season" in your media library.

_Default_ _**Season \{Season\}**_
