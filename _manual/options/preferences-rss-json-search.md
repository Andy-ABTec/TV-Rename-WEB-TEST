**RSS Search**

The "Preferred Terms:" text box acts as a filter on the RSS search and contains a semicolon delimited list. There must be a match in the RSS feed to return a search result. The default entry will only find RSS feed results that contain 720p or 1080p in the video names.

_Default:_ _**720p;1080p**_

"The Torrent RSS URLs:" can be any suitable RSS-feeds provided by indexers or public RSS websites and are used to search for missing files.

`Add` and `Remove` allow you to add and remove feeds, and `Open` presents the highlighted feed in a web browser.
