### The Scan Options Tab

![Preferences - the Scan Options tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-scan-options-01.png){:.pic-l}
This tab, in conjunction with data from the _**RSS/JSON**_ tab and the _**Torrents / NZB**_ tab, controls the _**Scan**_ tabs checks and actions.

The settings in here are more or less self explanatory, however remember that the _**Torrents / NZB**_ tab must be populated before the µTorrent, qBittorrent and SABnzdb options can be used, and, similarly the **RSS/JSON Search** must be populated before the RSS and JSON options can be used.

**NOTE:**{:style="color:red;"} If you use a NAS device as your media library and it is Linux based it has an epoch date of 01/01/1970&nbsp;00:00. Files cannot have a date/time-stamp earlier than this. If you have any TV Show episodes whose original release date was earlier than this and you have the _"Update files and folders with air date"_ box ticked they will be set to 01/01/1970&nbsp;00:00 to prevent repeated detection and attempts to change during scans.
