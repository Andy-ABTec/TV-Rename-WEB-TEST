### The Search Folders Tab

![Preferences - the Search Folders tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-search-folders-01.png){:.pic-l}
_Search Folders_ tell TV&nbsp;Rename where to look for TV Show episode files **BEFORE** they are processed and copied or moved to the media library.

The functionality of the first five tick boxes requires little explanation.

_Look in "Search Folders" for missing files_ enables the search functionality when ticked.

_Copy files, don't move_, if ticked will tell TV&nbsp;Rename to copy and files to the media library leaving the originals intact.

_Automatically create merge rules based on files in Search Folders_ is similar to the functionality found in **[Library Folders]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/options#the-library-folders-tab "Read about Library Folders")** except the appropriate record is created before moving/copying the file rather than after.

_Monitor folders for changes_, if ticked, will trigger a scan if Windows detects a change in any of the source folders.

_Copy future dated episodes found in Search Folders_ handles files that are found to exist  before their release date.
 
| *Defaults* | | |
| | _Look in "Search Folders" for missing files_ | _**Ticked**_ |
| | _&emsp;&emsp;Copy files, don't move_ | _**Un-ticked**_ |
| | _Automatically create merge rules based on files in Search Folders_ | _**Un-ticked**_ |
| | _Monitor folders for changes_ | _**Un-ticked**_ |
| | _Copy future dated episodes found in Search Folders_ | _**Un-ticked**_ |

The _Search Folders_ window allows you to add, delete or check the paths to your search folders.
 
Logical entries in here would be your downloads folder (if you download TV show episodes from the internet) or maybe your desktop (if you rip TV show episodes from DVD or Blu-ray). Or both!

Three buttons are available. `Add` opens an explorer style window so you can browse to the folder location you wish to add and click `OK`, `Remove` removes a highlighted row from the panel and `Open` opens an explorer window targeting the row highlighted in the panel.

The *Auto Add:* section comes in to play when the **Preferences>Search Folders - Notify when new shows are found** option is ticked.

The _Movie Terms:_ text box helps TV&nbsp;Rename identify "types" of video file.

_Default:_ _**dvdrip;camrip;screener;dvdscr;r5;bluray**_

The _Ignore Suffixes:_ text box tells TV Rename to ignore the specified suffixes.

_Default:_ _**1080p;720p**_

_Update episodes when higher quality ones found:_ tells TV&nbsp:;Rename to replace files in the video library with higher quality versionbs if they are found. 

_Default:_  _**Un-ticked**_ |

The final two options act as "helpers" for TV&nbsp;Rename when replacing videos that already exist in the library.

The _Priority override terms:_ text box defines the "hints" used to determine if a video has been improved at source.

_Default:_ _**PROPER;REPACK;RERIP**_ (Note the semicolon delimiter).

_Consider a file better if it is **X%** higher resolution/longer_ tells TV&nbsp;Rename to replace an existing library file if the newly found version is higher resolution and/or longer.

_Default:_ _**10%**_
