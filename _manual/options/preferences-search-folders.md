### The Search Folders Tab

![Preferences - the Search Folders tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-search-folders-02.png){:.pic-l}
The _**Search Folders**_ tab is used to tell TV&nbsp;Rename where to look for TV show episode files BEFORE they are processed. Logical entries in here would be your downloads folder (if you download TV show episodes from the internet) or maybe your desktop (if you rip TV show episodes from DVD or Blu-ray). Or both!

Three buttons are available at the bottom of the tab. `Add` opens an explorer style window so you can browse to the folder location you wish to add and click `OK`, `Remove` removes a highlighted row from the panel and `Open` opens an explorer window targeting the row highlighted in the panel.

| *Defaults:* | "Scan Type" | _**Full**_ |
|   | "Monitor folders for changes" | _**Un-ticked**_ |
