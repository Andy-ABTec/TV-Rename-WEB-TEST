### The Subtitles Tab

![Preferences - the Subtitles tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-subtitles-01.png){:.pic-l}
The _**Subtitles**_ tab is used to tell TV&nbsp;Rename how to handle subtitle files in your collection.

The Retain Language Specific Subtitles tick box (when ticked) tells TV&nbsp;Rename to retain subtitle files containing two or three letter language codes. For example: -

Video S01E01.en.srt

Subtitles must be of the form \*.language.extension, where language is 2 or 3 characters.

_Default:_ _**ticked**_

Subtitle files come in a number of guises of which one of the most common is a .sub file. These are text files structured in a way that media players can establish the start time, finish time and content of a subtitle and display it. Quite often sources for these files give them a .txt extension, for example: BigBuckBunny.txt. Ticking the "Rename .txt to .sub" option will tell TV&nbsp;Rename to rename these files when copied or moved.

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_
