### The Tree Coloring Tab

![Preferences - the Tree Coloring tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-tree-coloring-01.png){:.pic-l}
If you have a large catalogue of old TV Shows that you want to keep on the system, the _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ tab can be somewhat cluttered, but you don't want to remove anything from TV Rename. _**Tree Coloring**_ to the rescue...

Tree coloring allows you to change the color of the text on the left hand pane of the _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ tab depending on the status of the show or the show season.

To create a record:-
* Expand the _"Status:"_ drop-down and select the status you wish to match from the list.
* Select a color to associate with the status by either entering a web-safe color name or code in the _"Text Color:"_ box or clicking `Select Colour` and choosing from the pallet.
* Click the `Add` button and your new entry will appear the box above.

For example: to make finished shows less obtrusive in _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ expand the _"Status:"_ drop-down and select _"Show Status: Ended"_, in the _"Text Color:"_ box type _"#808080"_ and click `Add`. Back in the _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ tab; text for shows that have finished will be light grey and less obtrusive.

If you wish to remove a rule from the list just select it and click `Remove`.
