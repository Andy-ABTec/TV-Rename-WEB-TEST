<!-- START SEARCH ENGINES -------------------- -->
## Search Engines

![The Modify Search Engines window]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/modify-search-engines-01.png){:.pic-l}
The *Modify Search Engines* window controls TV&nbsp;Rename's outgoing interface with the world (other than TheTVDB). Here, you can configure how and where TV&nbsp;Rename points a web browser searching for files.

Using the `Add` and `Delete` buttons you can create or remove records at will, and the `Tags...` pop up a list of supported tags to remind you whats available. (The tags supported are the same as those listed in the [Filename Template Editor](#filename-template-editor).)

As an example, here is a URL entry for Google.

> https://www.google.co.uk/search?q={ShowName}+S{Season:2}E{Episode}

The list of URL's can be used when the _**When to watch**_ tab is open, the last used entry becomes the default, and appears in a text box to the right of the `Refresh` button. It can be changed by clicking the `â–¼` button and selecting another entry.

With a little ingenuity you can get really creative with these entries and pass your search to its specific target through a web proxy.
