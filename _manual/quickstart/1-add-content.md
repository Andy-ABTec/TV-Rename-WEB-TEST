2. Click the `Check >>` button, the selected path will be scanned and any content with a recognised structure automatically displayed in the _**Scan Results**_ tab.

3. In the _**Scan Results**_ tab, click `Auto ID All` and TV&nbsp;Rename will attempt to match the found content against [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com"), and ascertain if the show is part of a "flat" structure with all the episodes in one folder, or a "tree" structure with sub folders for each season and specials.<br /><br />
Any shows not identified will not have an entry in the **Show** column or the **thetvdb code** column; these can be fixed manually by highlighting the relevant row in the table and clicking `Edit` and using `Search` to interrogate [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com").

4. Once the match process has finished, click `Add & Close` and accept the confirmation, all the identified shows will be added to the _**My Shows**_ tab.

5. _**My Shows**_ will now be populated with the TV shows that have been identified, however there is currently no "Season" information. click `Refresh` and all the season information will be downloaded (depending on the size of your media library this may take a little while).

6. Once the download is complete you can browse the series information. Here, by right clicking on a show or season, you can edit the TV&nbsp;Rename settings to override information fetched from [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com") .

7. You can manually add shows by clicking the `Add` button in the _**My Shows**_ tab. Enter the show name, and click `Search` to find it.
