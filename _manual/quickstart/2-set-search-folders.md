## 2. Set your Search Folders

Whilst not strictly necessary at this point TV&nbsp;Rename needs to know where to look for new files to move to the library when adding o new episodes, so lets do it now.

![Options>Preferences>Search Folders]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-search-folders-01.png){:.pic-r}

In **Options>Preferences**, go to the _**Search Folders**_ tab and `Add` the locations you normally use for new episodes.

For example: I have two entries here, one points to my *Downloads* folder for stuff I get from the internet. The other points to my *Desktop* which I use as a target when ripping from my DVD collection.
