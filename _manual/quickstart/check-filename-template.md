## Check the Filename Template

Right, so now TV&nbsp;Rename knows where you media library is and where to look for new files, the only thing it doesn't know is how you want your files renamed.

Go to the _**Scan**_ tab and select a show that has some season and episode data (for this example I selected the DC show "Arrow").

Now go to **Options>Filename Template Editor** and you can see how the show will be named.

![Options>Preferences>Search Folders]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/filename-template-editor-01.png){:.pic-l}

The "Sample and Test" pane shows you how the shows episodes will be named using the current template.

You can also experiment with other preset templates using the "Presets" drop-down.

If none of these is exactly what you are looking for you can "Roll-your-Own" using the "Tags" drop-down to modify the current template.
