The Quick-Start Guide will help you with the initial setup TV Rename.

To return to this page click `Quickstart Guide` in TV&nbsp;Rename's **Help**, or browse to [{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/manual/quickstart]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/quickstart "Browse the TV&nbsp;Rename Quick-Start Guide on-line").

In a nutshell TV&nbsp;Rename will identify, move and rename media files from one folder (or group of folders) to another folder, partially identified by the settings in TV&nbsp;Rename and partially identified from the file name.

Once TV&nbsp;Rename knows about these folders (more on this later) it will process media files and move them to the specified location.

for example:&nbsp;-

The file: **c:\user\downloads\the-outpost-s01e06-hdtv-x264.mkv**  

could be "renamed" to

**m:\TV Series\The Outpost\Season 1\The Outpost - S01E06 - The Book of Names.mkv**


To do this TV&nbsp;Rename uses data acquired from [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com 'Visit thetvdb.com').

The initial setup can be somewhat daunting as there are many options and settings that control the way TV&nbsp;Rename behaves. Luckily these have sensible defaults and its actually relatively easy to get up and running providing you don't get distracted by the settings - this guide will help you through the process.  

> _The guide assumes you already have the beginnings of a **Media Library** - a folder (or folders) somewhere on your PC or NAS or whatever, with a bunch of tv show files in it (them). TV&nbsp;Rename doesn't care how these folders are organised, however to us mere humans probably "one folder per show" or "one folder per show with one sub-folder per season" would make sense in terms of being able to (manually) find stuff later if you really need to._
