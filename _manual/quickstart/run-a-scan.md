## Run a Scan

Now you're ready to run your first scan.

Go to the _**Scan**_ tab, and click `Full`. TV&nbsp;Rename will download any needed show information from [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com"), and compare it with the contents of the media library.

![Scan]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/main-window/scan-01.png){:.pic-c}

When the scan is complete, TV&nbsp;Rename will display its suggested changes in the main pane. Any ticked item will be actioned, so un-tick things you're not sure about, or use the check boxes in the bottom-right of the window.

For a more "granular" approach you can right-click on selected items to see actions for that specific item.

Click `Do Checked` and TV&nbsp;Rename will process the ticked actions, moving and renaming files as necessary.
