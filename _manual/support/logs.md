## Logs

If you are having problems with TV&nbsp;Rename or maybe someone on the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tvrename) has asked you about the content of your log file you have a couple of options...

If you are happy navigating through the windows file structure the log file (TVRename.log) can be found in: -

> \\Users\\\<username\>\\AppData\\Roaming\\TV Rename\\log\\

However, if you are uncomfortable doing this there is a handy entry in the **Help** menu (**Help>Log**).

This will either "tee" the log data (as it happens) into a new window so you can read it or copy the relevant bits for pasting in a [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tvrename) message.

_To use this feature click **Help>Log** first and then run the action (a Scan for example) you wish to monitor/capture._

Optionally, if you wish to view the entire log file clicking the `View Full Log` button in the bottom right corner of the window will open the file in Notepad.

More detailed information about the logs can be found in the [Technical Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/technical#log-files).
