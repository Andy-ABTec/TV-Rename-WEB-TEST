## Configuration Files

By default, all the configuration information and locally cached data from [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com") is stored in a series of JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation) files under the users Application folder (unless overridden using the command line option <span class="cli">/userfilepath</span>).

On Windows XP this is: -

> \\Documents and Settings\\\<user-name\>\\Application Data\\TV Rename

And on Windows Vista and later: -

> \\Users\\\<user-name\>\\AppData\\Roaming\\TV Rename

In either case the 2.1 folder contains the same set of files.

**If you wish to make a backup of your TV&nbsp;Rename setup a copy of this folder is all you need!**

It contains: -

**layout.json** - TV&nbsp;Rename's window position and size as well as column widths.

**settings.json** - Everything else not mentioned is stored in here. All your shows, Media Library paths, folder structures and settings. As with TheTVDB.xml this is only overwritten when you choose **File>Save**.

**settings.json.0 - settings.xml.9** - backup copies of TV RenameSettings.xml (FIFO).

**statistics.json** - TV&nbsp;Rename's historical statistics.

**tvdb.json** - The locally cached tvdb.com show season and episode information for everything listed in the _**My Shows**_ tab.

**tvdb.json.0 - tvdb.json.9** - A maximum of ten backup copies of theTVDB.xml file. A new file gets created here every time you click **File>Save** on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis.

## Log Files

The main log file (TVRename.log) can be found in: -
> \\Documents and Settings\\\<username\>\\AppData\\Roaming\\TV Rename\\log\\

on Windows XP or: -

> \\Users\\\<username\>\\AppData\\Roaming\\TV Rename\\log\\

On Windows Vista and later.

Log files are rotated into an "archive" folder (in the same location as TVRename.log) every time TV&nbsp;Rename is run or every 24 hours, whichever is sooner.

As with **tvdb.json** and **settings.json** a maximum of ten backup copies of the log file are kept (**TVRename00.log** - **TVRename09.log**) on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis.

Logging uses NLog. The configuration file ([NLog.config](https://github.com/TV-Rename/tvrename/blob/master/TVRename%23/NLog.config "Look at NLog.config in the TV-Rename Repo")) is stored in the TV&nbsp;Rename program folder.

You can read the [NLog Wiki](https://github.com/nlog/NLog/wiki/Configuration-file "Visit the NLog Wiki") for guidance on how to adjust the configuration file to collect more information.

When raising a bug please include a log file that illustrates the issue if you can, it will help us find a solution quickly.

## The Registry

The only information TV&nbsp;Rename stores in the registry is installation information which is used by Windows "Apps and Features" to un-install the program. But hey, why would you want to do that?
