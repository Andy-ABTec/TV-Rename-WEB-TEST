<!-- START CONFIGURATION FILES --------------- -->
## Configuration Files

By default, all the configuration information and locally cached data from [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com") is stored in a series of XML files under the users Application folder (unless overridden using the command line option <span class="cli">/userfilepath</span>).  They are stored at: -

> \\Users\\\<user-name\>\\AppData\\Roaming\\TVRename\\TVRename\\2.1

**If you wish to make a backup of your TV&nbsp;Rename setup a copy of this folder is all you need!**

It contains: -

| **TVRenameSettings.xml** | Everything else not mentioned is stored in here. All your shows, media library paths, folder structures and settings. This is only overwritten when you choose **File>Save**. |
| **TheTVDB.xml** | The locally cached tvdb.com show season and episode information for everything listed in the _**My Shows**_ tab. |
| **Layout.xml** | TV&nbsp;Rename's window position and size as well as column widths. |
| **Statistics.xml** | TV&nbsp;Rename's historical statistics. |
| **Languages.xml** | TV&nbsp;Rename's cache of possible languages to cover. |
| **TVRenameSettings.xml.0&emsp;<br />-TVRenameSettings.xml.9** | backup copies of TV Rename settings.xml (FIFO). |
| **TheTVDB.xml.0<br />-TheTVDB.xml.9** | A maximum of ten backup copies of theTVDB.xml file. A new file gets created here every time the system gets updates from theTVDB on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. |
