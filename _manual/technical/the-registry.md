## The Registry

The only information TV&nbsp;Rename stores in the registry is installation information which is used by Windows "Apps and Features" to un-install the program. But hey, why would you want to do that?

It also sets the compatability status of IE in the registry by settign a key at Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION so that the latest version of IE is used to render the graphical side of the application.
