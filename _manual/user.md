If you're new to TV&nbsp;Rename you should read the [Quick-Start&nbsp;Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/quickstart "Browse the TV&nbsp;Rename Quick-Start Guide") first (it's only a 5 minute read and will help you get up-and-running).

If you need help please sign up to the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tvrename "Visit the TVRename forum"), someone there will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

## Lets (not) start at the beginning...

In true technical manual fashion we're going to start at the end because, as is so often the case, it makes sense to see where your going to figure out how best to get there.
