### The Folders Tab

![Add/Edit Show - Folders]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/main-window/add-edit-folders-01.png){:.pic-l}

Completing the "Folders" Tab starts the magic! Returning to our example of "The Good Doctor": -

If the "Automatic Folders" box is ticked the path to the base folder can be typed in the text box or filled in by browsing, but either way, now TV&nbsp;Rename knows about the location of the shows base folder in the media library all the "really useful" stuff can begin!

The three radio buttons determine how the seasons of the show are handled: -

Selecting "Library Default" will tell TV&nbsp;Rename to create a sub folder for each season, namimg them "Season 1", "Season 2", "Season 3" etc.

Selecting "Base Folder" will tell TV&nbsp;Rename to store all the related files in the base folder specified previously.

Selecting "Custom Patern" allows you to specify (using text and tags) the naming of the season folders.

| _**Default:**_ | "Library Default" | _**Selected**_ |

If you require more granual control you can untick the "Automatic Folders" option and use the "Manual/Additional Fol;ders" entries to specify the exact name and location for each season of the show.
