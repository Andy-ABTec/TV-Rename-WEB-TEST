If you're new to TV&nbsp;Rename you should read the [Quick-Start&nbsp;Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/quickstart "Browse the TV&nbsp;Rename Quick-Start Guide") first (it's only a 5 minute read and will help you get up-and-running).

If you need help please sign up to the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tvrename "Visit the TVRename forum"), someone there will be happy to answer any questions you may have.
