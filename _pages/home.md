about:
  - title: "So what is TV Rename?"
  - excerpt: 'TV Rename is a media management tool that runs on Windows XP and later and looks after all your tv show files; making them presentable for Kodi (XBMC), Mede8er, pyTivo and other media hubs.<br /><br/>
  On the surface TV Rename will “fix” the names of TV shows…<br /><br />
  Lets say you’ve got a few TV show episodes saved as video files, they probably have names like this:<br /><br />
  _**The.Shannara.Chronicles.S02E03.WEBRip.x264-RARBG.mp4**_<br /><br />
  But you want to clean up the names, including the show/episode name and the season/episode number like this:<br /><br />
  _**The Shannara Chronicles - S02E03 - Graymark.mp4**_<br /><br />
  And you want it done automatically… This is the tool for you!'
